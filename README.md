# Idenfitication of Essential Protein-Protein interactions in Yeast

Instead of looking for the essential vertices, which has been done so many times in the past, the time has come to the essential edges. Why edges? Because an edge would be there’s some kind of relation between those genes or proteins. If we determine which edges we have to destroy, in order to get a drug, wouldn’t be better than destroy the whole protein or proteins? There are a few drugs doing this already. But just a few and not in the market (yet).

Why look for interactions? Targeting PPIs instead of individual proteins for drug discover has  a few potential advantages. The first is simply combinatorial: the number of PPIs may represent a significant increase in the number of potential drug targets. Last but not least, targeting PPIs may represent a significant increase in the biological specificity of inhibition, and consequently a dramatic decrease of side effects of potential drugs.

Why essential interactions? Basically, the interface of essential PPIs -those indispensable to the survival of an organism- represent an important class of targets for antimicrobial drugs.
